    <p class="about">
      Cancers arise by an evolutionary process as genetic and epigenetic changes
      accumulate in somatic cells allowing them to escape proliferative barriers
      and achieve immortality. The Nassour lab focuses on studying the role of
      mammalian telomeres in implementing these barriers and preventing the
      spread of cells that are susceptible to malignant transformation. Our
      research is focused on investigating how telomere functions synergize with
      the autophagy and innate immune pathways to create proliferative barriers,
      prevent cellular immortalization, and safeguard organisms from cancer as
      they age. By exploring the intricate interplay between these pathways, we
      strive to gain a deeper understanding of the early stages of malignant
      transformation and develop innovative strategies to prevent and treat
      cancer.

    <ul class="about">
      Currently, we are working on these aspects of telomere biology:
      <li>Telomere-dependent proliferative barriers</li>
      <li>Escape from crisis and immortalization</li>
      <li>Telomere-driven autophagy and cell death</li>
      <li>
        Telomere deprotection, genomic instability, and innate immune activation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="about">
      We strive to create a supportive, diverse, and inclusive laboratory
      environment with exceptional training and career development opportunities
      for fellows and students. We encourage you to explore our website and
      contact us for discussions, collaborations, or career opportunities.
