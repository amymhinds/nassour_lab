      <h3 class="exp">Expectations of Postdocs</h3>
      <p class="philo-exp">
        At our lab, we prioritize a supportive and collaborative environment. We seek individuals with inquisitive minds and strong critical thinking skills, who are fearless in addressing complex questions and humble enough to celebrate the success of others. We look for postdocs who are eager to learn new scientific skills, and willing to share their expertise with the lab. While each postdoc will have their own projects, they are expected to support one another in research, attend conferences, give presentations, and openly seek guidance when needed.
      </p>

      <h3 class="exp">Expectations of Graduate Students</h3>
      <p class="philo-exp">
        We seek graduate students passionate about exploring new scientific areas with an open mind. We value eagerness to learn from both successful and unsuccessful experiments, believing failures can be as informative as successes. Graduate students will lead their own research projects with support from myself and postdoctoral colleagues. We encourage attending scientific conferences, developing presentation skills, and openly communicating concerns and seeking guidance, as this is key to success in our lab.
      </p>

      <h3 class="exp">Expectations of PI</h3>
      <p class="philo-exp">
        As your supervisor, I am dedicated to supporting your career growth and development from the moment you consider joining our lab, throughout your tenure, and beyond. I value open communication and welcome feedback to improve my role as a PI. My door is always open to provide guidance and support, but I also expect you to reach out when you need my input. I prioritize the well-being of all lab members and am committed to your personal and professional growth. Know that I am invested in your success and will work with you to achieve your goals.
